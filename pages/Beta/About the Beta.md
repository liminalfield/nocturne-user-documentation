# About the Beta

Nocturne Writer is currently in beta for Windows and Linux. macOS support is planned.

## What Beta means here

Nocturne Writer is feature-complete and stable. The beta period is the final stage before general release, focused on real-world validation across different machines, workflows, and writing habits.

The purpose of the beta is to confirm that the application performs reliably in environments beyond our own, and to gather feedback from writers using it in practice.

## What to expect

Nocturne Writer is a local-first, offline application. There is no account to create, no cloud service to connect to, and no data leaves your machine unless you decide to push your content to a Git remote, like GitHub. Your writing is stored as plain Markdown files on your local filesystem and you retain full ownership of everything you create.

The application works entirely offline. An internet connection is not required at any point.

## Beta builds

Each beta build is valid for up to 30 days. When a new build is available, you will receive updated download links by email. You do not need to uninstall a previous build before installing a new one. Your files and settings are preserved between updates.

For details on what has changed in each build, see the Release Notes.

## Platforms

The beta is currently available for:

* **Windows** (x64)

* **Linux** (x64) — available as AppImage, .deb, and .pacman packages

macOS support is planned for a future release.

## Sharing feedback

Feedback of any kind is welcome and genuinely useful. This includes bug reports, workflow friction, things that felt confusing, features that didn't behave as expected, or anything you wished worked differently.

You don't need to be technical to share useful feedback. A sentence or two describing what happened and what you expected is often enough.

Send feedback to: **beta@nocturne-writer.com**

## After the Beta

Nocturne Writer will be available as a one-time purchase with a perpetual license; there are no subscriptions.

All registered beta testers will receive a discount on the full release. Details will be shared before the beta period ends.
